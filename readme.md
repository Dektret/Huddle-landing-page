### What I learned

This project helped me to learn how to properly use desktop first and mobile first design methods.

I also learnt how to use media queries to change the design according to the device types.

```css
@media (max-width:1024px) {
    .desktop {
        display: none;
    }
}

@media(min-width:1024px) {
    body {
        overflow: hidden;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Currently, I am a beginner in frontend web development. I started learning html and css just to develop additional skills. Now, that i have experienced desinging webpages and also knowing the fact that there is more to web designing than just html and css i started to have fun messing with webpages. I found myself consuming more and more content of web development over the internet and even though i understood nothing it was fun to watch and see people creating webpages out of nothing but just code. I am on a journey to learn frontend web development and then to become a full stack developer soon! 

### Useful resources

- (https://youtu.be/A0t0c_znZJ8) - This helped me for when i was stuck on how i could change the height and width of the image and article so that I could perfectly align them together. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
